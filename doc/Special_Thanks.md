# Special Thanks

This project cannot be finished without the following people's help:

* DUTY of VICTORY, who provides me the assignment paper and the HLab3 material.
* YiJie, who helps me with the VGA signal output checkout via the oscilloscope.
* The tutor of 3213 who works on 4/10/2017.
* A student who teach me how to burn the bitstream on the FGPA board on 6/10/2017 (Maybe, I cannot remember quite well).
